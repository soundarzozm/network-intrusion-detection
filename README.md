<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
This is a **Data Science** project based on the research article - [Toward Generating a New Intrusion Detection Dataset and Intrusion Traffic Characterization](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/322870768_Toward_Generating_a_New_Intrusion_Detection_Dataset_and_Intrusion_Traffic_Characterization).<br>
This project consists of *exploratory data analysis*, *extract transform load and model training* and *evaluation* using various data science packages.


### Built With

* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
* [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)
* [Keras](https://keras.io/)
* [Sci-Kit Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/)
* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)



<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

The project consists of three stages:
1. Exploratory Data Analysis
2. Extract Transform Load and Model Training
3. Model Evaluation

The .ipynb (Jupyter Notebook) files contain the three stages of the project.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

Exploratory Data Analysis refers to the initial exploration of the dataset along with subtle data analysis to obtain a vague idea about the dataset.<br>
This consists of statistical description, bar plots, etc.

## Extract Transform Load and Model Training
 
Extract Transform Load (ETL) refers to the process of retrieving data from one or more sources into a destination system which represents the data differently from the source or in a different context than the source.<br>
It also involves transforming the data, feature engineering, detailed data analysis and improving the overall quality of the data.<br>
Model definition refers to the process of choosing the models those are best suited for the dataset, along with the initial hyperparameters.<br>
Model training refers to the process of fitting the models to the training data.<br>

## Model Evaluation
 
Model evaluation refers to the process of evaluating the process of the models using certain appropriate evaluation metrics and tuning the hyperparameters again based on the results.<br>
<br>
It is an iterative process until required performance is obtained. 



<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

This model can be used at situations where cameras and proximity sensors are not available to determine if there is a human being nearby.<br>
The model uses various other factors such as:
* Temperature
* Humidity
* Smoke
* Light

to determine if there is a human being in proximity.


<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

See the [open issues](https://github.com/soundarzozm/network-intrusion-detection/issues) for a list of proposed features (and known issues).



<!-- CONTRIBUTING -->
## Contributing
